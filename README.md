# memefactory 🐾💉

Turn any `.exe`, `.sys`, `.dll` (or whatever) into a carrier of premium **energy** by injecting your favorite ASCII art straight into a new `.femboy` section + (optionally) the PDB path.

Works best with Among Us, catgirls, trap memes and/or existential dread.

### Features?
- Creates new `.femboy` section
- Injects your ASCII art as UTF-8 text data

### Preview (what people will see in a hex editor / debugger)
